Together with 5C, Hi-C does not limit to the study to a specific locus in the genome, and can be used to study chromatin interaction across the genome. To achieve high-throughput, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions followed by deep sequencing. Mapping the sequenced reads back to genome will reveal the origin of the fragments involved in the ligation events." []
