Together with 5C, Hi-C does not limit to the study to a specific locus in the genome, and can be used to study chromatin interaction across the genome. To achieve high-throughput, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions followed by deep sequencing.

The fluidics subsystem flows the sequencing reagents across the wells of the PicoTiterPlate device, and moves the spent reagents from the PicoTiterPlate device to the waste receptacle. The optics subsystem consists of a CCD camera and a camera controller. The camera captures the light emitted in the wells of the PicoTiterPlate device during each step of the sequencing cycle, and sends the digital images to the computer subsystem for processing. The computer controls the other Sequencer subsystems, and processes the digital images sent by the camera to extract the DNA sequence information.
