def: "Hi-C is a method for analysing 3-dimensional organisation and interaction of chromatin, belonging to the class of techniques collectively called \"Chromosome Conformation Capture\", in which chromatin is crosslinked, then digested, and re-ligated in such a way that only DNA fragments that are covalently linked together form ligation products. Together with 5C, Hi-C does not limit to the study to a specific locus in the genome, and can be used to study chromatin interaction across the genome. To achieve high-throughput, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions followed by deep sequencing. Mapping the sequenced reads back to genome will reveal the origin of the fragments involved in the ligation events." []
